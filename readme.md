# Real world Typescript usage

## Introduction

[Também em português](./readme-pt.md)

Many juniors developer learn a lot of things about Typescript. They pay a course to know all about it. But even me as a Senior developer, i don't use EVERYTHING about Typescript. I use only what i need. And i think it's the same for you.

To solve this problem, i create this repository to show you how to use Typescript in real world. I will show you how to use Typescript in a real project. I will show you how to use Typescript with React, NodeJS, Vue, etc...

I am not disacouraging you to learn everything about Typescript. I just want to show you how to use Typescript in real world. And i think it's the best way to learn something.

## How to use this repository

I will only use MD, because it's the best way to show you code and text in the same file. I will use a lot of code example to show you how to use Typescript in real world.

You dont have to follow the folder in order. You can go to the folder you want and read the MD file. I will try to explain everything in the MD file called `readme.md`.
